# FoodOrderingChatBot
India Bot food ordering chatbot

For the program to work you will need the folder "IndiaBot Full" and the folder "JSON"
The orders file that stores previous orders will appear in the original folder "FoodOrderingChatBot" if run from VSCode. 
If the program is run from command prompt, the orders file will appear in the "IndiaBot Full" folder.


Thank you
